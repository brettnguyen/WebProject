The home tab takes you to the home page, the logout page logs you out, and the profile page takes you to the profile page.

**BUGS:**

-If you are logged in and you revisit the localhost:3000 that it is linked to and you havent cleared your browsers cache you will recieve an error/issues. Make sure to click the logout tab on top of the login screen ONLY if you see it on the login page or clear your browsers cache.

-The lottie animation for the login page doesn't always fit the screen.

-On the home page the green lines going vertical don't reach the bottom of the page but they do go further down as the page increases in size with the amount of notes that populate the page.

-The input that goes over the note when you click edit isn't the correct size and doesn't fit the same size as normal notes.

-The input edit text is a little off spacing too.

-The profile and home tab icons on the home page aren't on the profile page.

-Resizing the page on the home page causes objects to move away from there current locations
